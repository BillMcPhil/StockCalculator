# StockCalculator
Basic python code that can pull stock information from the internet and use it to calculate how much money you've made.
Stock information from the yfinance python library, and UI made using the Tkinter library.

# Note: Please do not use this for any commercial use
This is just a fun personal project for myself. It would be extremely impractical to use this for any actual business
purposes. So please don't use this to actually track your finances.
