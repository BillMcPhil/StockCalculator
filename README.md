# StockTracker
Basic python code that can pull stock information from the internet and use it to calculate how much money you've made

# Note: Please do not use this for any commercial use
This is just a fun personal project for myself. It would be extremely impractical to use this for any actual business
purposes. So please don't use this to actually track your finances.
